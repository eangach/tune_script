Ruby gem to control iTunes using AppleScript

Uses AppleScript scripts to drive iTunes. This is not a low level interface and will not be
as efficient as a low level interface. The main purpose is to have an interface which should still work when iTunes or
OSX is upgraded.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tune_script'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tune_script
